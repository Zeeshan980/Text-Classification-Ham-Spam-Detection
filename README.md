# NLP Text Classification: Ham Spam Detection

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to detect whether an input text is classified as "ham" (not spam) or "spam." The project combines traditional LSTM-based deep learning with the power of BERT for natural language processing.

### Key Features

- Text preprocessing and feature engineering
- LSTM-based deep learning model
- BERT-based model for enhanced performance
- Machine learning model training
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
